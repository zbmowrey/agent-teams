# Hiring Planning Skill

## Problem

Early-stage startups need to make critical hiring decisions (roles, timing, compensation, culture fit) without dedicated HR leadership, leading to costly mis-hires and suboptimal team composition.

## Spec

See [docs/specs/plan-hiring/spec.md](../../specs/plan-hiring/spec.md) -- approved by product-skeptic (2026-02-19).
