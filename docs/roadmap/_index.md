# Product Roadmap

> **Source of truth**: Individual item files in this directory. This index is a convenience summary.
> **Last updated**: 2026-02-18

## Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `core-framework` | Improvements to the skill orchestration engine — agent spawning, communication, quality gates |
| `new-skills` | New slash commands beyond the existing core set |
| `business-skills` | Non-engineering skills for startup business functions (sales, marketing, finance, etc.) |
| `developer-experience` | Installation, configuration, onboarding, and day-to-day usability |
| `quality-reliability` | Testing infrastructure, error handling, resilience, and observability |
| `documentation` | Guides, tutorials, examples, and reference material |

## Prioritization Framework

Items are prioritized using two dimensions:

**Priority tiers**:
- **P1 (Critical)**: Blocks adoption or causes incorrect behavior. Must be addressed first.
- **P2 (Important)**: Significantly improves the product. Address after P1s.
- **P3 (Nice-to-have)**: Polish, convenience, or future-facing. Address when capacity allows.

**Scoring criteria** (used to assign priority):

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Impact | 40% | How many users benefit? How much value does it create? |
| Risk | 30% | What breaks if we don't do this? What goes wrong if we do it badly? |
| Effort | 20% | How complex? A high-effort P1 still outranks a low-effort P3. |
| Dependencies | 10% | Does this unblock other high-value work? |

## Status Legend

- 🟢 `ready` — Spec approved, ready for Implementation Team
- 🔵 `impl_in_progress` — Implementation underway
- ✅ `complete` — Done and verified

### P3 — Nice-to-Have (Business)

> **Strategy note**: Strategic planning (`/plan-strategy`) is scoped within the existing `/plan-product` skill rather than a standalone skill. The plan-product team already covers roadmap assessment, prioritization, and competitive analysis.
