## Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `core-framework` | Improvements to the skill orchestration engine — agent spawning, communication, quality gates |
| `new-skills` | New slash commands beyond the existing three (`/plan-product`, `/build-product`, `/review-quality`) |
| `developer-experience` | Installation, configuration, onboarding, and day-to-day usability |
| `quality-reliability` | Testing infrastructure, error handling, resilience, and observability |
| `documentation` | Guides, tutorials, examples, and reference material |

## Prioritization Framework

Items are prioritized using two dimensions:

**Priority tiers**:
- **P1 (Critical)**: Blocks adoption or causes incorrect behavior. Must be addressed first.
- **P2 (Important)**: Significantly improves the product. Address after P1s.
- **P3 (Nice-to-have)**: Polish, convenience, or future-facing. Address when capacity allows.

**Scoring criteria** (used to assign priority):

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Impact | 40% | How many users benefit? How much value does it create? |
| Risk | 30% | What breaks if we don't do this? What goes wrong if we do it badly? |
| Effort | 20% | How complex? A high-effort P1 still outranks a low-effort P3. |
| Dependencies | 10% | Does this unblock other high-value work? |
