# Content Deduplication Specification

## Summary

Add HTML comment markers around the Shared Principles and Communication Protocol sections in all 3 SKILL.md files, normalize cosmetic inconsistencies, and define a CI-validation contract (implemented by P2-04) that enforces content consistency. This is "validated duplication" -- the content remains in each file for self-containment, but drift is automatically detected. Designate `plan-product/SKILL.md` as the authoritative source for shared content.

## Problem

Three SKILL.md files contain ~126 duplicated lines across two sections:

1. **Shared Principles** (~27 lines): 12 numbered principles in 4 tiers. Nearly identical across all 3 files, with one cosmetic inconsistency (plan-product uses single quotes while the others use double quotes).

2. **Communication Protocol** (~34 lines of shared content): Tool mapping note, "When to Message" table (11 rows), "Message Format" template. Structurally identical but with intentional per-skill variation -- the "Plan ready for review" table row references different skeptic names per skill (`product-skeptic`, `quality-skeptic`, `ops-skeptic`). Additionally, `build-product` has a unique "Contract Negotiation Pattern" subsection (~56 lines) not present in the other skills.

This duplication creates two problems:
- **Maintenance drift risk**: Any change to shared principles requires editing 3 files identically. The cosmetic inconsistencies already present (quote style, horizontal rules, table formatting) demonstrate that manual synchronization is unreliable.
- **Scaling pressure**: As the skill catalog expands beyond 3 skills, the duplication compounds. At 8+ skills, validated duplication should be revisited in favor of shared-file extraction (see ADR-002 decision trigger).

Token cost impact is modest (~2,520 redundant tokens per invocation with 5 agents) and is NOT the primary motivation. The primary motivation is maintainability and correctness.

## Solution

### 1. Add Section Markers

Add HTML comment markers around shared sections in each SKILL.md:

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN SHARED: principles -->
<!-- Authoritative source: plan-product/SKILL.md. Keep in sync across all skills. -->
## Shared Principles
... (content) ...
<!-- END SHARED: principles -->

<!-- BEGIN SHARED: communication-protocol -->
<!-- Authoritative source: plan-product/SKILL.md. Keep in sync across all skills. -->
## Communication Protocol
... (shared content) ...
<!-- END SHARED: communication-protocol -->

<!-- BEGIN SKILL-SPECIFIC: communication-extras -->
... (per-skill content like Contract Negotiation Pattern) ...
<!-- END SKILL-SPECIFIC: communication-extras -->
```

Markers serve two purposes:
1. **CI validation (P2-04)**: Validation scripts extract content between matching markers and compare across files.
2. **Developer guidance**: Markers signal "this content must match in all SKILL.md files."

### 2. Normalize Cosmetic Inconsistencies

Before adding markers, normalize existing inconsistencies so shared sections are byte-identical:

| Inconsistency | Current State | Normalized To |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Quote style | plan-product uses `'message'`, others use `"message"` | Double quotes (`"message"`) everywhere |
| Horizontal rule | plan-product lacks `---` between Principles and Protocol | Add `---` to plan-product (matching others) |
| Table formatting | plan-product uses `\|col1\|col2\|`, others use `\| col1 \| col2 \|` | Padded format everywhere |

### 3. Designate Authoritative Source

`plan-product/SKILL.md` is the authoritative source for shared content. When editing Shared Principles or Communication Protocol:
1. Edit plan-product first
2. Copy the changed content to build-product and review-quality
3. CI (P2-04) catches any drift

This convention is documented in the marker comments.

### 4. Handle Per-Skill Variations

The Communication Protocol has one intentional variation: the skeptic name in the "Plan ready for review" table row. This is handled by:
- CI validates structural equivalence for the Communication Protocol (same rows, same columns), NOT byte-identity
- The skeptic name column is allowed to vary per skill
- Byte-identity is required only for the Shared Principles section

### 5. CI Validation Contract (Implemented by P2-04)

The validation script (specified here, built in P2-04) will:
1. Find all SKILL.md files matching `plugins/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`
2. Extract content between `<!-- BEGIN SHARED: principles -->` and `<!-- END SHARED: principles -->` markers
3. Compare extracted Shared Principles content across all files -- must be byte-identical
4. Extract content between `<!-- BEGIN SHARED: communication-protocol -->` markers
5. Compare structural equivalence for Communication Protocol: same headings, same table rows (skeptic name column may vary), same message format template
6. Report drift with a diff showing exactly what diverged

### 6. ADR-002 Decision Trigger

When the skill count exceeds 8, revisit the validated duplication approach. At that scale:
- Editing 8+ files for a single principle change is burdensome
- Plugin-scoped shared files with degraded portability become justified
- The markers make future extraction straightforward (content between markers moves to the shared file)

## Constraints

1. **SKILL.md files remain self-contained.** Each SKILL.md must function in isolation without reading external shared files. This is the core architectural property that makes skills portable.
2. **No changes to agent behavior.** Agents read the same content they read today. Markers are HTML comments -- invisible in the content agents process.
3. **No SKILL.md bloat.** Markers add 4-6 lines per file (comments only). No content is added or removed.
4. **Per-skill variations are preserved.** The skeptic name in the Communication Protocol table row remains skill-specific.
5. **Validation is defined here, built in P2-04.** This spec defines WHAT is validated. The P2-04 spec defines HOW (script language, CI configuration, error reporting).

## Out of Scope

- **Extracting shared content to external files** -- deferred until skill count exceeds 8 (per ADR-002 decision trigger)
- **CLAUDE.md extraction** -- rejected due to context pollution and ownership conflict (see Researcher findings)
- **Checkpoint file normalization** -- historical checkpoint files with `role` instead of `agent` are not retroactively fixed
- **Content changes** -- this spec normalizes formatting, not content. Principle wording changes are a separate effort
- **P2-04 implementation** -- CI scripts, GitHub Actions workflow, and validation tooling are out of scope

## Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `plugins/conclave/skills/plan-product/SKILL.md` | Add markers around Shared Principles and Communication Protocol. Normalize quote style to double quotes. Add `---` separator. Normalize table formatting to padded style. |
| `plugins/conclave/skills/build-product/SKILL.md` | Add markers around Shared Principles, Communication Protocol, and Contract Negotiation Pattern (as SKILL-SPECIFIC). |
| `plugins/conclave/skills/review-quality/SKILL.md` | Add markers around Shared Principles and Communication Protocol. |

## Files to Create

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `docs/architecture/ADR-002-content-deduplication-strategy.md` | ADR documenting the validated duplication decision, alternatives considered, and the 8-skill revision trigger. |

## Success Criteria

1. All 3 SKILL.md files contain `<!-- BEGIN SHARED: principles -->` and `<!-- END SHARED: principles -->` markers around their Shared Principles section.
2. All 3 SKILL.md files contain `<!-- BEGIN SHARED: communication-protocol -->` and `<!-- END SHARED: communication-protocol -->` markers around their Communication Protocol section.
3. The content between `principles` markers is byte-identical across all 3 files after normalization.
4. The content between `communication-protocol` markers is structurally identical across all 3 files (same headings, same table rows; skeptic name column may vary).
5. `plan-product/SKILL.md` is designated as the authoritative source in marker comments.
6. Quote style is normalized to double quotes in all 3 files.
7. Table formatting is normalized to padded format in all 3 files.
8. `build-product/SKILL.md` has `<!-- BEGIN SKILL-SPECIFIC: communication-extras -->` markers around its Contract Negotiation Pattern.
9. ADR-002 exists at `docs/architecture/ADR-002-content-deduplication-strategy.md` with the 8-skill revision trigger documented.
10. No agent behavior changes -- skills function identically before and after.
