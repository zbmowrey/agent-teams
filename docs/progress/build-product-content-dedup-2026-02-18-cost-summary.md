# Cost Summary: build-product / content-deduplication

## Team Composition

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| tech-lead | opus | Team Lead (orchestration only) |
| impl-architect | opus | Implementation Architect |
| quality-skeptic | opus | Quality Skeptic (2 review gates) |
| backend-eng | sonnet | Backend Engineer (plan-product + build-product edits) |
| frontend-eng | sonnet | Frontend Engineer (review-quality edits + ADR-002) |

## Mode

Standard (not lightweight)

## Work Summary

- impl-architect: Produced 11-edit implementation plan with byte-identity verification
- quality-skeptic: Pre-implementation gate APPROVED, post-implementation gate APPROVED
- backend-eng: Applied 9 edits to plan-product/SKILL.md and build-product/SKILL.md
- frontend-eng: Applied 2 edits to review-quality/SKILL.md, created ADR-002

## Notes

This was a documentation/configuration task with no backend/frontend code split. The backend-eng and frontend-eng roles were repurposed to parallelize file editing across different SKILL.md files. No API contract negotiation was needed. Both quality gates passed on first submission (no rejections).
