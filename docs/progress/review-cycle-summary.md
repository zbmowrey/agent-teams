# Review Cycle Session Summary

## Summary

The plan-product team conducted a general review cycle to assess the remaining P2 roadmap items and select the next feature to spec. Three agents (researcher, architect, product-skeptic) independently evaluated P2-02 (Skill Composability), P2-03 (Progress Observability), and P2-07 (Universal Shared Principles). All three unanimously recommended P2-03 as the next feature. The architect wrote the detailed spec, the product-skeptic reviewed and approved it with one trivial correction (step numbering), and the spec is now ready for implementation.

## Outcome

- **Feature selected**: P2-03 Progress Observability
- **Spec created**: `docs/specs/progress-observability/spec.md` (status: approved)
- **Roadmap updated**: P2-03 status changed from `not_started` to `ready`
- **Priority ordering established** for remaining P2 items:
  1. P2-03 Progress Observability -- spec approved, ready for implementation
  2. P2-07 Universal Shared Principles -- defer until first business skill validates approach
  3. P2-02 Skill Composability -- requires platform research on skill-to-skill invocation
  4. P2-08 Plugin Organization -- correctly deferred until 2+ business skills exist

## Key Findings

- P2-02 has a potential showstopper: no documented mechanism for skill-to-skill invocation in Claude Code
- P2-07 is premature per ADR-002's 8-skill threshold (currently 3 skills)
- P2-03 leverages ~100% of existing checkpoint infrastructure with minimal new components
- Only build-product currently writes session summaries; plan-product and review-quality do not (gap addressed in P2-03 spec)
- P2-07 and P2-08 are referenced in `_index.md` but have no corresponding roadmap files (data integrity issue, not bundled into P2-03)

## Files Created

- `docs/specs/progress-observability/spec.md` -- Full P2-03 specification
- `docs/progress/review-cycle-researcher.md` -- Research findings
- `docs/progress/review-cycle-architect.md` -- Technical assessment
- `docs/progress/review-cycle-product-skeptic.md` -- Skeptic reviews (feature selection + spec)
- `docs/progress/review-cycle-summary.md` -- This file

## Files Modified

- `docs/roadmap/P2-03-progress-observability.md` -- Status: not_started -> ready
- `docs/roadmap/_index.md` -- P2-03 emoji: red -> green
