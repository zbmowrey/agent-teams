# Review Cycle 6 -- Technical Architecture Assessment

## 1. CI Validator Status -- ALL GREEN

All 5 validators pass against current codebase (post P3-10 implementation, post 14-stub creation):

| Validator | Result | Files Checked | Notes |
|-----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| `skill-structure.sh` | PASS (4 checks) | 6 SKILL.md files | Flaky printf bug from RC5 was fixed during P3-10 implementation |
| `skill-shared-content.sh` | PASS (3 checks) | 6 SKILL.md files | strategy-skeptic normalization added during P3-10 implementation |
| `roadmap-frontmatter.sh` | PASS (2 checks) | 31 roadmap files | Effort casing bugs from RC5 were fixed during P3-10 implementation |
| `spec-frontmatter.sh` | PASS (1 check) | 9 spec files | Clean |
| `progress-checkpoint.sh` | PASS (1 check) | 53 checkpoint files | VALID_TEAMS enum was updated during P3-10 implementation |

**Key observation**: All 3 validator bugs identified in RC5 (flaky skill-structure.sh, roadmap casing, progress-checkpoint teams) were fixed during the P3-10 implementation cycle. The CI pipeline is now fully clean.

## 2. P2-07 (Universal Shared Principles) Readiness Assessment

### Current State

- **Total skills**: 6 (plan-product, build-product, review-quality, setup-project, draft-investor-update, plan-sales)
- **Multi-agent skills with shared content**: 5 (all except setup-project which is single-agent)
- **ADR-002 trigger threshold**: 8 skills

### Assessment: NOT READY -- Wait for 8/8

ADR-002 is explicit: "When the skill count exceeds 8, revisit this approach." We are at 6/8 total skills (5 with shared content).

**Why 6/8 is insufficient for extraction analysis**:
1. ADR-002 says "exceeds 8" -- we are not there yet
2. The extraction analysis requires understanding the full diversity of shared content patterns. At 6 skills, we have 3 consensus patterns validated (Hub-and-Spoke, Pipeline, Collaborative Analysis) with 1 remaining (Structured Debate, targeted for P3-14). Starting extraction before Structured Debate is validated risks designing an extraction mechanism that does not accommodate all pattern variations.
3. The current marker-based system works well at 6 skills. The maintenance cost is manageable. Premature extraction adds complexity without sufficient benefit.

**Recommendation**: Do NOT begin P2-07 extraction analysis yet. The right trigger is after P3-14 (plan-hiring) is implemented, which would bring us to 7 total skills and validate the final consensus pattern. At 7/8, pre-planning extraction makes sense. At 8, execute.

### What P2-07 Actually Requires

Per the roadmap file:
- Extract shared principles and communication protocol into authoritative source files
- All multi-agent skills reference the authoritative source
- CI validator confirms consistency
- Adding a new skill does not require copying shared content

This is a structural refactor, not a feature. It needs stability in the shared content (all patterns validated) before extraction.

## 3. P2-08 (Plugin Organization) Readiness Assessment

### Prerequisite Status: MET

The prerequisite was "2+ business skills built and validated." Current business skills:
1. `/draft-investor-update` (P3-22) -- COMPLETE, Pipeline pattern
2. `/plan-sales` (P3-10) -- COMPLETE, Collaborative Analysis pattern

**Assessment: P2-08 IS READY to be specced.**

### Observations Informing Plugin Organization

Now that we have 2 business skills, patterns are emerging:

1. **Domain separation is clear**: Engineering skills (plan-product, build-product, review-quality) vs. Business skills (draft-investor-update, plan-sales) have distinct concerns, output directories, and user personas.

2. **setup-project is a cross-cutting utility**: It serves both domains (single-agent, no shared content). It does not fit cleanly in either an engineering or business plugin.

3. **Shared content is cross-cutting**: The Shared Principles and Communication Protocol are identical across both engineering and business multi-agent skills. Any plugin split must preserve the shared content management system.

4. **Output directory patterns differ**: Engineering skills write to `docs/specs/`, `docs/progress/`. Business skills create skill-specific output directories (`docs/investor-updates/`, `docs/sales-plans/`). This is a natural boundary.

5. **Consensus patterns span domains**: Hub-and-Spoke (engineering), Pipeline (business), Collaborative Analysis (business). Patterns are not domain-exclusive, so splitting by pattern is not viable.

**Recommendation for P2-08 spec**: The most natural split is domain-based (engineering vs. business) with shared content remaining in a common location. setup-project either stays in engineering (as a developer tool) or becomes a standalone utility plugin. The spec should evaluate all 3 options from the roadmap file:
1. Split into `conclave-engineering` and `conclave-business` plugins
2. Split by collaboration pattern (not recommended -- patterns span domains)
3. Keep single plugin, reorganize internal directory structure

## 4. Architecture Debt from RC5

### ADR-001 Status

ADR-001 body still says "Proposed" (line 5 of the file: `## Status\n\nProposed`). It has no YAML frontmatter, unlike ADR-002 and ADR-003 which have proper frontmatter with `status: "accepted"`. This is a cosmetic debt item but matters for consistency.

**Recommendation**: LOW priority. Update ADR-001 to:
- Add YAML frontmatter matching ADR-002/003 format
- Change body status from "Proposed" to "Accepted"

### ADR-002 Threshold

At 6 total skills (5 multi-agent with shared content), we are approaching but have not hit the 8-skill trigger. See P2-07 assessment above. The marker-based system is healthy. No action needed.

### Output Directory Proliferation

RC5 flagged potential proliferation of `docs/investor-updates/` and `docs/sales-plans/`. Checking current state: neither directory exists yet on disk (they are created at runtime when skills are first invoked). This is a runtime concern, not a structural one.

At 2 business skills, this is not yet a problem. At 3+ business skills with custom output directories, consider standardizing a naming convention (e.g., `docs/outputs/{skill-name}/`). This can be addressed as part of P2-08 (Plugin Organization) if the spec includes output directory conventions.

**Recommendation**: Defer to P2-08. Not actionable as standalone debt.

## 5. Roadmap Stub Files -- CREATED (14 files)

Created all 14 missing roadmap stub files per RC5 Skeptic condition. Each stub contains:
- Proper YAML frontmatter (title, status, priority, category, effort, impact, dependencies, created, updated)
- Single-sentence problem statement
- No spec content (stubs only, per Skeptic condition)

### Files Created

| File | Title | Category | Effort |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| P3-04-triage-incident.md | Incident Triage Skill | new-skills | medium |
| P3-05-review-debt.md | Tech Debt Review Skill | new-skills | medium |
| P3-06-design-api.md | API Design Skill | new-skills | medium |
| P3-07-plan-migration.md | Migration Planning Skill | new-skills | large |
| P3-11-plan-marketing.md | Marketing Planning Skill | business-skills | medium |
| P3-12-plan-finance.md | Finance Planning Skill | business-skills | large |
| P3-14-plan-hiring.md | Hiring Planning Skill | business-skills | medium |
| P3-15-plan-customer-success.md | Customer Success Skill | business-skills | medium |
| P3-16-build-sales-collateral.md | Sales Collateral Skill | business-skills | medium |
| P3-17-build-content.md | Content Production Skill | business-skills | medium |
| P3-18-review-legal.md | Legal Review Skill | business-skills | large |
| P3-19-plan-analytics.md | Analytics Planning Skill | business-skills | medium |
| P3-20-plan-operations.md | Operations Planning Skill | business-skills | medium |
| P3-21-plan-onboarding.md | Employee Onboarding Skill | business-skills | small |

**Effort value note**: The _index.md lists "Medium-Large" (P3-12, P3-18) and "Small-Medium" (P3-21) but the roadmap-frontmatter validator only accepts `small | medium | large`. Mapped: Medium-Large -> large, Small-Medium -> small. All 14 stubs pass the validator. The _index.md has a richer effort vocabulary than the validator enforces -- this is a minor inconsistency that could be resolved by either expanding the validator enum or normalizing _index.md. Low priority.

**Roadmap coverage**: 31/31 items now have individual `.md` files. The roadmap data integrity debt from RC4/RC5 is fully resolved.

## 6. Summary and Recommendations

| Priority | Item | Status | Action |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| **DONE** | Run all 5 CI validators | ALL GREEN | No action needed |
| **DONE** | Create 14 roadmap stubs | 31/31 coverage | Fully resolved |
| **ASSESSMENT** | P2-07 readiness | NOT READY (6/8) | Wait until 7/8 (post P3-14) to pre-plan, 8+ to execute |
| **ASSESSMENT** | P2-08 readiness | READY to spec | Prerequisite met (2/2 business skills) |
| **LOW** | ADR-001 status | Still "Proposed" | Update to "Accepted" with frontmatter |
| **LOW** | Effort enum mismatch | _index.md vs validator | Defer -- cosmetic |
| **DEFERRED** | Output directory convention | 2 skills, dirs not yet created | Address in P2-08 spec |

### Key Takeaways

1. **CI is fully healthy.** All 3 RC5 bugs were fixed during P3-10 implementation. The build pipeline is trustworthy.
2. **P2-08 is the next actionable P2 item.** Its prerequisite is met. P2-07 is not yet actionable.
3. **Roadmap coverage is complete.** All 31 items have files. No more data integrity debt.
4. **Architecture debt is minimal.** ADR-001 status is cosmetic. ADR-002 threshold is not yet reached. No structural issues.
