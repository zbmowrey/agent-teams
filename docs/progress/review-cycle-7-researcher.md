# Review Cycle 7: Researcher Findings

## 1. Implementation Pipeline: P3-14 (plan-hiring)

**Status**: SPECCED ✅ AND IMPLEMENTED (uncommitted) — needs verification, commit, and roadmap update.

**Evidence**:
- Spec: `docs/specs/plan-hiring/spec.md` — approved by product-skeptic (2026-02-19)
- System design: `docs/architecture/plan-hiring-system-design.md` — 1126 lines
- SKILL.md: `plugins/conclave/skills/plan-hiring/SKILL.md` — **1560 lines** (spec estimated 1400-1600)
- Validator: `scripts/validators/skill-shared-content.sh` — modified with 4 new sed expressions for bias-skeptic/fit-skeptic
- Build-product team progress files exist: impl-architect (complete), backend-eng (in_progress checkpoint but SKILL.md appears written), frontend-eng (complete — validator update), quality-skeptic (pre-impl gate approved)
- **All files are untracked in git** (`??` status). Nothing committed.
- Roadmap `_index.md` shows P3-14 as 🟢 `ready` — NOT updated to `complete`

**Assessment (High confidence)**: The build-product team appears to have implemented P3-14. The SKILL.md exists at the expected size, the validator was updated, and progress files from impl-architect, backend-eng, frontend-eng, and quality-skeptic exist. However:

1. **No git commit** — all artifacts are untracked
2. **Post-implementation CI validation status unknown** — the quality-skeptic checkpoint shows pre-impl gate approved, but no post-impl review checkpoint found
3. **Roadmap not updated** — still shows `ready`, not `complete`
4. **Structured Debate pattern not validated by actual execution** — the SKILL.md was built but `/plan-hiring` has not been run to produce an actual hiring plan

**Blockers for P3-14 completion**: None structural. Needs: CI validation run, post-impl verification, git commit, roadmap update to `complete`.

## 2. P2-07 (Universal Principles): 7/8 After P3-14

**ADR-002 threshold**: "When the skill count exceeds 8, revisit this approach." Per P2-07 roadmap file: "ADR-002 threshold is 8+."

**Current skill count** (SKILL.md files on disk):

| # | Skill | Status | Shared Content? |
|---|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | plan-product | ✅ committed | Yes |
| 2 | build-product | ✅ committed | Yes |
| 3 | review-quality | ✅ committed | Yes |
| 4 | setup-project | ✅ committed | No (single-agent) |
| 5 | draft-investor-update | ✅ committed | Yes |
| 6 | plan-sales | ✅ committed | Yes |
| 7 | plan-hiring | 🟡 uncommitted | Yes |

**Total**: 7 skills (6 committed + 1 uncommitted). 6 have shared content markers.

**After P3-14 committed**: 7/8. **One more skill triggers P2-07.**

**Should we pre-plan?**
- RC6 recommended: "Re-assess P2-07 (7/8) in RC7." ✅ Doing that now.
- The next skill built (any P3 skill) will be #8, triggering the ADR-002 revision threshold.
- Pre-planning is warranted: the Product Team should decide WHICH mechanism to use (includes, references, build-time injection) before the 8th skill is built, so the 8th skill can use the new approach from the start.
- **Recommendation**: Start pre-planning P2-07 in RC7/RC8. Don't spec yet, but identify the extraction mechanism so it's ready when skill #8 is built.

**P2-07 roadmap file is stale**: Says "Currently 5 total skills, 4 multi-agent skills with shared content." Actual: 7 total, 6 with shared content. Needs update.

## 3. P2-08 (Plugin Organization): Ready to Spec

**Prerequisite**: 2+ business skills built and validated. **MET** (2/2 validated in RC6; plan-hiring adds a 3rd built but not yet validated).

**RC6 deferral condition**: "Spec P3-14 first, revisit in RC7." **MET** — P3-14 is specced and implemented.

**Current evidence for plugin boundary decisions**:

| Business Skill | Pattern | Status |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| draft-investor-update | Pipeline | ✅ validated |
| plan-sales | Collaborative Analysis | ✅ validated |
| plan-hiring | Structured Debate | implemented, pending validation |

**3 business skills + 4 engineering skills = 7 total skills.** With 2 patterns validated and 1 implemented (pending validation), there's sufficient data to inform plugin boundaries.

**Options from P2-08 file**:
1. Split into `conclave-engineering` and `conclave-business` plugins
2. Split by collaboration pattern (hub-spoke, pipeline, collaborative-analysis, structured-debate)
3. Keep single plugin but reorganize internal directory structure

**Assessment (High confidence)**: P2-08 is ready to spec. The deferral conditions from RC6 are all met. Three business skills across three patterns provide meaningful data about skill diversity and organizational needs.

**Recommendation**: Spec P2-08 in the next product cycle.

## 4. P2-02 (Skill Composability): Low Priority, Not Blocking

**Status**: 🔴 `not_started`. Priority P2. Effort: Large.

**Dependencies**: Depends on P1-02 (state-persistence) ✅ complete. No reverse dependencies — nothing in the roadmap lists P2-02 as a dependency.

**Is it blocking anything?** No. Checked all roadmap items — none declare a dependency on P2-02.

**RC5 skeptic directive**: "Stop reporting P2-02." The skeptic determined this is not a priority and doesn't warrant cycle time.

**Assessment (High confidence)**: P2-02 remains correctly parked. The plan→build→review workflow chain is a valid user need but is not blocking adoption or other roadmap items. Large effort with medium impact. No evidence that users are requesting this.

**Recommendation**: Continue to deprioritize. Revisit only when user feedback indicates demand for skill chaining.

## 5. P3 Backlog Assessment

**14 roadmap stubs created in RC6.** All remain 🔴 `not_started`. No changes since creation.

### Business Skills by Pattern (from design guidelines)

| Pattern | Skills | Count |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Collaborative Analysis | plan-marketing, plan-customer-success, plan-analytics | 3 |
| Structured Debate | plan-finance, review-legal, plan-operations | 3 |
| Pipeline | build-sales-collateral, build-content, plan-onboarding | 3 |

### Elevation Candidates

**Any P3 business skill built next will be skill #8, triggering P2-07.** This creates a sequencing consideration:

1. **Option A**: Build the next business skill FIRST, then spec P2-07 and P2-08 together. Risk: the 8th skill duplicates shared content that will soon be extracted.
2. **Option B**: Spec and implement P2-07 and P2-08 FIRST, then build the next business skill with the new architecture. More efficient but delays new user-facing features.
3. **Option C**: Spec P2-07 and P2-08 while the next business skill is being specced. Parallel track. Most efficient overall.

**No individual P3 item has a compelling case for elevation.** The P3 business skills are all medium effort with similar impact profiles. The choice of which to build next should be driven by:
- Which pattern benefits from a second implementation? (All three could use it)
- User demand (no data available)
- Strategic value to the framework as a whole

**If forced to pick one**: `plan-marketing` (P3-11) — Collaborative Analysis pattern already validated, medium effort, natural complement to plan-sales. Second Collaborative Analysis skill would further validate the pattern.

### Engineering P3 Items

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| P3-01 Custom Agent Roles | 🔴 | Large effort. Not urgent. |
| P3-03 Contribution Guide | 🔴 | Small effort. Documentation. Could be done anytime. |
| P3-04 Incident Triage | 🔴 | First engineering business-adjacent skill. Medium effort. |
| P3-05 Tech Debt Review | 🔴 | Medium effort. Useful but not urgent. |
| P3-06 API Design | 🔴 | Medium effort. Depends on user need. |
| P3-07 Migration Planning | 🔴 | Large effort. Advanced use case. |

**No engineering P3 items warrant elevation.** None are blocking, and the current focus on business skills (building toward P2-07/P2-08 thresholds) is the right strategic direction.

## 6. Pattern Validation Status

| Pattern | Pathfinder | Status | Confidence |
|---------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Pipeline | P3-22 (draft-investor-update) | ✅ VALIDATED | High — implemented and producing real output |
| Collaborative Analysis | P3-10 (plan-sales) | ✅ VALIDATED | High — implemented with 1182-line SKILL.md, lessons extracted |
| Structured Debate | P3-14 (plan-hiring) | 🟡 IMPLEMENTED, NOT YET VALIDATED | Medium — SKILL.md exists (1560 lines) but `/plan-hiring` has not been run to produce an actual hiring plan |

**Key distinction**: "Implemented" means the SKILL.md was written by the build-product team. "Validated" means the skill was run and produced a real output that demonstrates the pattern works. Pipeline and Collaborative Analysis are both validated. Structured Debate is implemented but pending first execution.

**What validation requires**: Run `/plan-hiring` on a project (even with minimal user data) and confirm: (1) the 6-phase protocol executes, (2) cross-examination produces substantive challenges, (3) position tracking works, (4) synthesis is coherent, (5) both skeptics produce meaningful reviews.

## 7. Delta Since RC6

| Change | Detail | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| P3-14 specced | Spec approved by product-skeptic. 20 success criteria. | `docs/specs/plan-hiring/spec.md` |
| P3-14 system design | 1126-line architecture document. | `docs/architecture/plan-hiring-system-design.md` |
| P3-14 implemented (uncommitted) | 1560-line SKILL.md + validator update. Build-product team executed. | `plugins/conclave/skills/plan-hiring/SKILL.md`, progress files |
| Validator updated | 4 new sed expressions for bias-skeptic/fit-skeptic | `scripts/validators/skill-shared-content.sh` modified |
| Skill count | 6 → 7 (with uncommitted plan-hiring) | 7 SKILL.md files on disk |
| P2-07 progress | 6/8 → 7/8 | One more skill triggers extraction threshold |
| P2-08 readiness | Deferred in RC6 → All deferral conditions met | 3/3 business skills, P3-14 specced+implemented |
| Business skill count | 2 → 3 (with plan-hiring) | draft-investor-update, plan-sales, plan-hiring |
| Patterns implemented | 2 validated + 1 specced → 2 validated + 1 implemented | Structured Debate advanced from spec to implementation |

**What did NOT change**:
- P2-02 (Skill Composability): Still 🔴 not_started. No activity.
- P2-07 (Universal Principles): Still 🔴 not_started. Count advanced but threshold not met.
- P2-08 (Plugin Organization): Still 🔴 not_started. But deferral conditions now met.
- All 14 P3 stubs from RC6: Still 🔴 not_started.
- P2-07 roadmap file: Stale — says "4 multi-agent skills" but actual count is 6 with shared content.

## Recommended Actions for RC7

1. **Verify and commit P3-14 implementation** — Run CI validators, confirm SKILL.md passes all checks, commit all plan-hiring artifacts, update roadmap to ✅ `complete`.
2. **Validate Structured Debate pattern** — Run `/plan-hiring` to produce a real hiring plan. This is the final step to mark the pattern as VALIDATED.
3. **Pre-plan P2-07 (Universal Principles)** — At 7/8, decide the extraction mechanism now. Don't spec yet, but document the technical approach so it's ready when skill #8 is built. P2-08 plugin boundaries depend on knowing how shared content extraction works.
4. **Spec P2-08 (Plugin Organization)** — All deferral conditions met. 3 business skills, 2 validated + 1 implemented patterns. Spec AFTER P2-07 extraction mechanism is decided.
5. **Update P2-07 roadmap file** — Correct the stale count (4 → 6 multi-agent, 7 total).
6. **Continue to park P2-02** — Per RC5 skeptic directive. Not blocking anything.
