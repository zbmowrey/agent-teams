# Review Cycle 7 Session Summary

## Summary

The plan-product team conducted Review Cycle 7 following the completion of P3-14 (plan-hiring) spec and its subsequent implementation by the build-product team. The team assessed P3-14 implementation status, P2-07/P2-08 readiness, and the P3 backlog. The skeptic approved with two corrections (researcher's P2-08 evidence chain inconsistency, architect's backwards P3-14 framing) and reordered the action sequence to place P2-07 pre-planning before P2-08 speccing.

## Outcome

- **P3-14 (plan-hiring) confirmed IMPLEMENTED** — 1560-line SKILL.md exists, validators pass, but nothing committed. Needs: CI validation, commit, roadmap update to `complete`.
- **Structured Debate pattern: IMPLEMENTED, NOT VALIDATED** — SKILL.md built but `/plan-hiring` has not been run to produce actual output.
- **P2-07 at 7/8 skills** — One more multi-agent skill triggers ADR-002 extraction threshold. Pre-planning recommended.
- **P2-08 deferral conditions met** — But architect argues (skeptic agrees) that P2-07 mechanism must be designed first because shared content coupling is the binding constraint.
- **P2-07 roadmap file is stale** — Says "4 multi-agent skills" but actual is 6 with shared content.
- **P2-02 stays parked** — Per RC5 directive. Not blocking anything.

## Major Discovery: P3-14 Already Implemented

The researcher discovered that the build-product team has already implemented P3-14:
- `plugins/conclave/skills/plan-hiring/SKILL.md` — 1560 lines / 76KB
- `scripts/validators/skill-shared-content.sh` — updated with 4 new sed expressions
- Build-product progress files exist (impl-architect, backend-eng, frontend-eng, quality-skeptic)
- All validators pass (7 skills checked)
- **But**: All files are untracked in git (`??` status). Roadmap still shows `ready`, not `complete`.
- **But**: Backend-eng checkpoint still shows `in_progress` (stale). No post-impl review checkpoint.

## P2-08 Divergence Resolution

| Agent | Recommendation | Rationale |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| Researcher | Spec P2-08 now | All deferral conditions met (3 business skills, P3-14 specced+implemented) |
| Architect | Defer to skill #8 | Shared content management is the binding constraint; plugin boundaries depend on P2-07 extraction mechanism |
| Skeptic | Architect right on timing, researcher right on urgency | Pre-plan P2-07 FIRST, then spec P2-08 with that knowledge |
| **Resolution** | **P2-07 pre-plan → P2-08 spec** | P2-08 depends on P2-07's mechanism design |

## Skeptic Corrections

1. **Researcher P2-08 "3/3" count**: Researcher counted plan-hiring toward "built and validated" prerequisite, but own Section 6 says Structured Debate is "IMPLEMENTED, NOT YET VALIDATED." Conclusion correct (2/2 validated still met from RC6) but evidence chain inconsistent.
2. **Architect P3-14 framing**: Architect said "READY for build-product team" but build team already built it. Should say "IMPLEMENTED (uncommitted); needs validation and commit."

## Recommended Action Sequence (Skeptic-Approved)

1. **Verify and commit P3-14** — Run CI validators, confirm all checks pass, commit all plan-hiring artifacts, update roadmap to ✅ `complete`
2. **Validate Structured Debate pattern** — Run `/plan-hiring` to produce actual output. Confirms 6-phase protocol, cross-examination, position tracking, synthesis, dual-skeptic reviews all work.
3. **Update P2-07 roadmap file** — Correct stale count: "4 multi-agent skills" → "6 multi-agent skills with shared content, 7 total"
4. **Pre-plan P2-07 extraction mechanism** — Decide: includes, references, or build-time injection. Design BEFORE skill #8 is built.
5. **Spec P2-08 with P2-07 mechanism in mind** — AFTER P2-07 pre-plan. Plugin boundaries depend on extraction approach.
6. **Park P2-02** — Per RC5 directive. Not blocking.

## P2 Status

| Item | Prerequisite | Status | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| P2-07 (Universal Principles) | 8+ skills | 7/8 — NOT READY | Pre-plan extraction mechanism |
| P2-08 (Plugin Organization) | 2+ business skills | 3+ — MET | Spec AFTER P2-07 pre-plan |

## Pattern Validation Status

| Pattern | Status | Pathfinder |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Pipeline | VALIDATED | P3-22 (draft-investor-update) |
| Collaborative Analysis | VALIDATED | P3-10 (plan-sales) |
| Structured Debate | IMPLEMENTED, NOT VALIDATED | P3-14 (plan-hiring) — needs first execution |

## Skill Inventory (7 total)

| # | Skill | Status | Shared Content? | Lines | Size |
|---|-------|--------|----------------|-------|------|
| 1 | plan-product | committed | Yes | 389 | 20KB |
| 2 | build-product | committed | Yes | 472 | 25KB |
| 3 | review-quality | committed | Yes | 440 | 24KB |
| 4 | setup-project | committed | No (single-agent) | 393 | 17KB |
| 5 | draft-investor-update | committed | Yes | 737 | 35KB |
| 6 | plan-sales | committed | Yes | 1182 | 56KB |
| 7 | plan-hiring | uncommitted | Yes | 1560 | 76KB |

## Process Issues Noted

1. **Checkpoint hygiene**: Backend-eng checkpoint for plan-hiring shows `in_progress` despite SKILL.md being complete. Progress-checkpoint validator should flag stale in_progress checkpoints.
2. **SKILL.md size growth**: Business skills averaging 56KB vs engineering 22KB. plan-hiring at 76KB is 3.5x engineering average. Future specs should include size budgets or demonstrate reduced format redundancy.
3. **Output directory proliferation**: Each business skill creates its own `docs/{type}-plans/` directory. Manageable now but worth monitoring.

## Delta Since Review Cycle 6

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| P3-14 specced AND implemented | Spec approved, then build-product implemented. SKILL.md: 1560 lines. All uncommitted. |
| Skill count | 6 → 7 (with uncommitted plan-hiring) |
| P2-07 progress | 6/8 → 7/8 |
| P2-08 deferral conditions | All met. But: spec AFTER P2-07 pre-plan. |
| Structured Debate | Was specced-only in RC6 → now implemented (not validated) |
| Business skill count | 2 → 3 (draft-investor-update, plan-sales, plan-hiring) |
