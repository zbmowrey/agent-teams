# Review Cycle 6 Session Summary

## Summary

The plan-product team conducted Review Cycle 6 following the completion of P3-10 (plan-sales) implementation. The team assessed P3-10 implementation lessons, P2-07/P2-08 readiness, created 14 missing roadmap stubs, and confirmed P3-14 (plan-hiring) is cleared to spec. The skeptic approved with one minor correction (researcher's P2-07 count in delta table was 5/8, should be 6/8).

## Outcome

- **P3-14 (plan-hiring) cleared to spec** — RC5 sequencing condition met (P3-10 implemented)
- **14 roadmap stubs created** — 31/31 roadmap file coverage. Data integrity debt resolved.
- **P2-08 prerequisite updated** — 1/2 → 2/2 business skills in roadmap file
- **P2-07 NOT ready** — 6/8 skills, ADR-002 threshold is 8+
- **P2-08 ready to spec but deferred** — Spec P3-14 first, revisit in RC7

## P3-10 Implementation Lessons (for P3-14 Spec)

| Lesson | Detail | Impact on P3-14 |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| 55KB SKILL.md | Largest in framework. Exposed printf truncation bug (fixed). | Expect 1200-1400 lines for Structured Debate |
| Lead-driven synthesis | Phase 3 breaks delegate mode — lead writes synthesis. Works. | Follow same precedent for P3-14. Spec should address synthesizing opposing positions vs. parallel research. |
| Dual-skeptic pattern | Validator update is mechanical. Pattern scales. | Bias Skeptic + Fit Skeptic need validator entries |
| Agent idle risk | Quality-skeptic went idle during post-impl review. | P3-14 spec should include explicit fallback for cross-examination phase |
| CI bug bundling | 3 bugs fixed during implementation, not before. | Fix any known CI issues before P3-14 implementation |

## P2 Status

| Item | Prerequisite | Status | Action |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| P2-07 (Universal Principles) | 8+ skills | 6/8 — NOT READY | Wait for 7/8 to pre-plan |
| P2-08 (Plugin Organization) | 2+ business skills | 2/2 — MET | Deferred: spec P3-14 first |

## Pattern Validation Status

| Pattern | Status | Pathfinder |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Pipeline | VALIDATED | P3-22 (draft-investor-update) |
| Collaborative Analysis | VALIDATED | P3-10 (plan-sales) |
| Structured Debate | NOT YET SPECCED | P3-14 (plan-hiring) — cleared to spec |

## Key Disagreement Resolved

| Agent | P2-08 Recommendation | Rationale |
|-------|----------------------|-----------|
| Researcher | Wait (Structured Debate not validated) | Adding a prerequisite not in the roadmap |
| Architect | Spec now (prerequisite met) | Domain boundaries are pattern-independent |
| Skeptic | Met but defer (sequencing priority) | Spec P3-14 first, P2-08 second. Same practical outcome as researcher but for different reasons. |
| **Resolution** | **Defer to RC7** | P3-14 takes priority. P2-08 benefits from one more data point. |

## Skeptic Conditions

No new conditions added. All RC5 conditions met:
1. P3-14 sequencing (P3-10 implemented) — MET
2. Roadmap stubs minimal — MET (spot-checked 3/14)
3. Stop reporting P2-02 — MET
4. CI fixes before P3-10 — MET (bundled in implementation)

## Recommended Action Sequence

1. **Spec P3-14 (plan-hiring)** — Structured Debate pathfinder. Cleared to proceed.
2. **Implement P3-14** — Validates final consensus pattern. Advances P2-07 to 7/8.
3. **RC7**: Re-assess P2-07 (7/8) and P2-08 (3 business skills, 3 patterns)

## Delta Since Review Cycle 5

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| P3-10 implemented | Status: ready → complete. 1182-line SKILL.md. |
| 3 CI bugs fixed | skill-structure.sh, roadmap casing, progress-checkpoint teams |
| Collaborative Analysis VALIDATED | Was specced-only in RC5 |
| P2-08 prerequisite MET | 2/2 business skills (was 1/2) |
| P2-07 at 6/8 | Was 5/8 in RC5 (counting total skills) |
| 14 roadmap stubs created | 31/31 file coverage. Data integrity debt resolved. |
| Skeptic sequencing condition MET | P3-14 cleared to spec |
