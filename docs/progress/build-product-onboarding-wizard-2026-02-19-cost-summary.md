# Build-Product: Onboarding Wizard -- Cost Summary

## Team Composition

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| Team Lead (Tech Lead) | Opus | Orchestration, roadmap updates |
| Impl Architect | Opus | Implementation planning |
| Backend Engineer | Sonnet | Validator script modifications |
| Frontend Engineer | Sonnet | SKILL.md authoring |
| Quality Skeptic | Opus | Pre/post implementation review |

## Deliverables Produced

1. **Implementation plan** -- file-by-file plan with dependency graph
2. **Validator modifications** -- skill-structure.sh + skill-shared-content.sh
3. **New skill** -- plugins/conclave/skills/setup-project/SKILL.md
4. **Progress summary** -- docs/progress/onboarding-wizard-summary.md

## Review Cycles

- Pre-implementation gate: 1 cycle (approved first pass)
- Post-implementation gate: 1 cycle (approved first pass)
- One mid-implementation blocker (skill-shared-content.sh B1/B2 failures) resolved by backend-eng

## Notes

- The B1/B2 validator blocker was discovered by frontend-eng during implementation and resolved quickly by backend-eng
- Plugin.json does NOT need modification — skills are auto-discovered from directory structure
- This is the first single-agent skill in the framework, establishing a new pattern for utility skills
