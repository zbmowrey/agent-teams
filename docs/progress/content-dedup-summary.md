# P2-05: Content Deduplication -- Progress

## Summary

Added HTML comment markers around the Shared Principles and Communication Protocol sections in all 3 SKILL.md files. Normalized cosmetic inconsistencies in plan-product/SKILL.md (quote style, table formatting, horizontal rule separator) so shared content is byte-identical. Created ADR-002 documenting the validated duplication strategy and the 8-skill revision trigger.

## Changes

### Normalization (plan-product only)
- Normalized single quotes to double quotes in Shared Principle #2 and Communication Protocol tool mapping note
- Normalized table formatting from unpadded to padded style in the "When to Message" table
- Added `---` horizontal rule before Shared Principles section to match other files

### Shared Section Markers (all 3 files)
- Added `<!-- BEGIN SHARED: principles -->` / `<!-- END SHARED: principles -->` around Shared Principles
- Added `<!-- BEGIN SHARED: communication-protocol -->` / `<!-- END SHARED: communication-protocol -->` around Communication Protocol
- Added `<!-- Authoritative source: plan-product/SKILL.md. Keep in sync across all skills. -->` after each BEGIN marker
- Added `<!-- BEGIN SKILL-SPECIFIC: communication-extras -->` / `<!-- END SKILL-SPECIFIC: communication-extras -->` around build-product's Contract Negotiation Pattern

### ADR-002
- Created ADR documenting the validated duplication decision, alternatives considered (CLAUDE.md extraction, shared plugin file), and the 8-skill revision trigger
