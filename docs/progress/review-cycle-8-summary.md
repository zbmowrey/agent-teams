# Review Cycle 8 Session Summary

## Summary

The plan-product team conducted Review Cycle 8 following the user's request to identify what needs planning next and to consider new features, helper scripts, and cross-skill utilities. The team assessed RC7 action sequence progress, P2-07/P2-08 readiness, the P3 backlog, and new opportunities beyond the existing roadmap. The skeptic approved with 5 corrections and 2 conditions (ADR-002 threshold wording, counting methodology).

## Outcome

- **RC7 Action Sequence: 3/6 complete.** P3-14 committed ✅, P2-07 roadmap updated ✅, P2-02 parked ✅. Still undone: validate Structured Debate, pre-plan P2-07 extraction mechanism, spec P2-08.
- **P2-07 extraction mechanism: Build-time injection recommended.** Architect evaluated 3 approaches, rejected includes and references (break SKILL.md self-containment), recommended build-time injection. Skeptic approved the design.
- **ADR-002 threshold: Corrected.** "Exceeds 8" means >8 (trigger at 9th skill), not >=8. P2-07 roadmap file corrected. Pre-planning at 7 skills is still prudent.
- **P2-08 dependency: Added.** P2-08 now explicitly depends on P2-07 in frontmatter.
- **New features/scripts: 8 actionable proposals identified.** Top items: shared content sync script, cost aggregation script, stale checkpoint validator, skill scaffolding script.
- **Net-new skill concepts: 4 proposed, 1 endorsed.** `/retrospective` (sprint/cycle retrospective) has highest value-to-effort ratio. Skeptic also proposed skill regression test harness, cost budget enforcement, and skill diff report.
- **README stale.** Lists 3/7 skills. Needs update.

## Skeptic-Approved Action Sequence

### Immediate (this cycle or next):

1. **Fix P2-07 trigger wording** — ✅ DONE (applied during this cycle)
2. **Update P2-08 dependencies** — ✅ DONE (applied during this cycle)
3. **Update README** — Reflect all 7 skills, correct project structure, update cost section.
4. **Build shared content sync script** — `scripts/sync-shared-content.sh`. P2-07 precursor, solves current manual editing pain. Small effort, high value.
5. **Draft ADR-003 for P2-07 build-time injection** — Per architect's design. Resolve: (a) frontmatter extension compatibility with Claude Code, (b) counting methodology, (c) source file location.

### Before next skill build:

6. **Validate Structured Debate** — Run `/plan-hiring` with a real scenario. RC7 Action #2, still undone.
7. **Build cost aggregation script** — `scripts/cost-report.sh`. Small effort.
8. **Add stale checkpoint validator** — Extend progress-checkpoint.sh to flag `in_progress` checkpoints older than N days.

### After ADR-003 is finalized:

9. **Build skill scaffolding script** — Generates skeleton SKILL.md with P2-07 mechanism support.
10. **Spec P2-08** — With P2-07 extraction mechanism designed. Investigate Claude Code nested directory discovery first.
11. **Spec next P3 skill** — P3-11 (plan-marketing) or P3-04 (triage-incident), depending on business vs engineering priority. Either triggers P2-07 implementation.

## Skeptic Corrections Applied

| # | Correction | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | ADR-002 threshold says "exceeds 8" (>8), not "at 8". P2-07 file corrected. | ✅ Applied |
| 2 | Architect's "Update P2-07 roadmap file" recommendation is stale (already done in RC7). | Noted, removed from actions. |
| 3 | P2-08 frontmatter missing P2-07 dependency. | ✅ Applied |
| 4 | ADR-002 "skill count" ambiguity (total vs multi-agent) — resolve in ADR-003. | Deferred to ADR-003 |
| 5 | P3-08 and P3-09 missing from roadmap index. | Confirmed: IDs intentionally skipped (P3-08, P3-09, P3-13 all unused). |

## Skeptic Conditions

1. **P2-07 roadmap file must correctly represent ADR-002 trigger language.** ✅ Applied.
2. **ADR-003 must resolve counting methodology.** Deferred to ADR-003 drafting.

## Key New Feature/Script Proposals

### Skeptic Tier 1 — Do Immediately:

| Proposal | Description | Effort |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Shared content sync script | `scripts/sync-shared-content.sh` — reads authoritative source, replaces shared blocks in all SKILL.md files, preserves per-skill skeptic names | Small-Medium |
| README update | Update to reflect all 7 skills, correct project structure, patterns | Small |

### Skeptic Tier 2 — Do Soon:

| Proposal | Description | Effort |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Skill scaffolding script | `scripts/scaffold-skill.sh <name> <pattern>` — generates skeleton SKILL.md | Small-Medium (after P2-07) |
| Cost aggregation script | `scripts/cost-report.sh` — parses 18 cost summary files, aggregates by skill/session type | Small |
| Stale checkpoint validator | Extend progress-checkpoint.sh to flag `in_progress` > N days | Small |

### Skeptic Additions (not from researcher):

| Proposal | Description | Effort |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Skill regression test harness | Invoke skill with canned scenario, validate output structure | Medium |
| Cost budget enforcement | Pre-flight cost estimate, warn if exceeding per-skill budget | Small-Medium |
| Skill diff report | Show only non-shared-content diff for SKILL.md changes | Small |

### Net-New Skill Concepts:

| Skill | Pattern | Skeptic Verdict |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `/retrospective` | Collaborative Analysis | HIGH value, build after P2-07 |
| `/plan-infrastructure` | Structured Debate | MODERATE, differentiation from plan-product unclear |
| `/competitive-analysis` | Collaborative Analysis | LOW, overlaps plan-product |
| `/design-system` | Pipeline | LOW, niche audience |

## SKILL.md Size Growth Trend

| Skill | Lines | Trend |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Engineering avg | 434 | Stable |
| draft-investor-update | 737 | — |
| plan-sales | 1182 | — |
| plan-hiring | 1560 | Accelerating |
| Business avg | 1160 | 2.7x engineering |

P2-07 shared content extraction saves ~130 lines/skill. Template extraction (output templates, format definitions) would save more but is out of P2-07 scope.

## P2 Status

| Item | Threshold | Current | Status |
|------|-----------|---------|--------|
| P2-07 (Universal Principles) | >8 skills (ADR-002) | 7 total, 6 multi-agent | Pre-plan NOW, implement with skill #9 |
| P2-08 (Plugin Organization) | 2+ business skills | 3 (2 validated) | Spec AFTER P2-07 pre-plan |
| P2-02 (Skill Composability) | — | — | Parked per RC5 |

## Pattern Validation Status

| Pattern | Skill | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Hub-and-Spoke | plan-product, build-product, review-quality | VALIDATED |
| Pipeline | draft-investor-update | VALIDATED |
| Collaborative Analysis | plan-sales | VALIDATED |
| Structured Debate | plan-hiring | IMPLEMENTED, NOT VALIDATED |
| Single-Agent | setup-project | VALIDATED |

## Delta Since Review Cycle 7

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| P3-14 committed | Was uncommitted in RC7 → now committed (35c0822) |
| RC7 actions 1+3 confirmed complete | Was recommended → now verified |
| ADR-002 threshold corrected | Was "at 8" → now "exceeds 8 (>8)" |
| P2-08 dependency added | Was `[]` → now includes P2-07 |
| New features/scripts identified | 8 actionable proposals + 3 skeptic additions |
| Net-new skill concepts | 4 proposed, `/retrospective` endorsed |
| SKILL.md size trend documented | Business skills 2.7x engineering, accelerating |

## Process Issues Noted

1. **ADR-002 threshold misquoted across 3 review cycles** (RC6, RC7, RC8). Agents repeatedly cite "threshold at 8" despite ADR-002 saying "exceeds 8." Now corrected in P2-07 file.
2. **README significantly stale** — 3/7 skills listed. User-facing impact.
3. **Progress directory has ~115 files** — no cleanup/archive mechanism.
4. **P3-08, P3-09, P3-13 IDs intentionally skipped** — not documented anywhere.
