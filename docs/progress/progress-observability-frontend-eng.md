## Progress Notes

- [00:00] Claimed task #3, read implementation plan at docs/progress/progress-observability-impl-architect.md
- [00:01] Read all 3 SKILL.md files to understand current state before editing
- [00:02] Verified all 9 edits already applied (files were partially modified by another agent or prior session):
  - plan-product/SKILL.md: argument-hint has "status", Determine Mode has status bullet, Orchestration Flow has step 8
  - build-product/SKILL.md: argument-hint has "status", Determine Mode has status bullet, step 7 wording aligned
  - review-quality/SKILL.md: argument-hint has "status", Determine Mode has status bullet, Orchestration Flow has step 9
- [00:03] Wrote checkpoint to docs/progress/progress-observability-frontend-eng.md
