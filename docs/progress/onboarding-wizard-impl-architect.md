## Progress Notes

- [00:00] Claimed task #1: Create implementation plan for onboarding-wizard
- [00:00] Read spec, system design, ADR-003, validator, all 3 SKILL.md files, templates, plugin.json, CI workflow
- [00:00] Drafting implementation plan
- [00:01] Plan complete. Broadcast to team. Sent to quality-skeptic for pre-implementation gate review.
- [00:01] Awaiting quality-skeptic approval before Tasks #2 and #3 can proceed.
- [00:02] APPROVED by quality-skeptic. No blocking issues. 3 non-blocking observations noted:
  - (1) Architecture template is 36 lines, not 37 (cosmetic -- embed verbatim regardless)
  - (2) Stack hints handling: ensure Step 3 includes docs/stack-hints/ creation + bundled hint copy
  - (3) --force must still prompt for CLAUDE.md confirmation (constraint #3)
- [00:02] Handed off to backend-eng (Task #2: validator) and frontend-eng (Task #3: SKILL.md)
