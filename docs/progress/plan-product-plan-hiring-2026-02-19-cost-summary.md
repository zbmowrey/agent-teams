# Cost Summary: Plan-Product Plan-Hiring Spec

## Session: 2026-02-19

### Agent Configuration

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| Team Lead (product-owner) | opus | Orchestration, divergence resolution, spec writing, roadmap update |
| researcher | opus | Domain research, debate protocol design, divergence reconciliation |
| architect | opus | System design, architecture revision per skeptic feedback |
| product-skeptic | opus | Initial review (REJECTED), architecture re-review (APPROVED), final spec review (APPROVED) |

### Agent Count: 4 (1 lead + 3 spawned)

Note: product-skeptic was re-spawned once for the final spec review after context compaction (total: 2 skeptic instances across the session).

### Model Usage

- **Opus**: 4 agents (team-lead, researcher, architect, product-skeptic)
- **Sonnet**: 0 agents

### Work Performed

- P3-14 (plan-hiring) Structured Debate skill fully specced
- Researcher: comprehensive domain analysis, debate protocol design, 10 research areas covered
- Architect: full system design (1074 lines), revised after skeptic review
- Product Skeptic: 3 review passes (initial REJECTED, architecture APPROVED, spec APPROVED)
- Team Lead: 5 divergences resolved, spec written, roadmap updated
- 5 new files created (spec, system design, 3 progress files)
- 2 files updated (roadmap stub, roadmap index)

### Outcome

- P3-14 spec approved, status: `ready` for implementation
- First Structured Debate skill specced -- new consensus pattern ready for validation
- All 12 skeptic requirements met
- Pathfinder: lessons from implementation will inform future Structured Debate skills (plan-finance, review-legal, plan-operations)
