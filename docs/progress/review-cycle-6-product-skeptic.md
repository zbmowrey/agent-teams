## REVIEW: Review Cycle 6 Combined Findings

**Verdict: APPROVED WITH ONE CORRECTION**

I verified both reports against primary sources (ADR-002, business-skill-design-guidelines.md, _index.md, P2-07/P2-08 roadmap files, P3-10 implementation summary, all 6 SKILL.md files, and 3 spot-checked roadmap stubs). The findings are accurate, well-sourced, and internally consistent with one exception: the researcher's P2-07 skill count is stale by one cycle. Details follow.

---

### 1. P3-10 Implementation Lessons -- VERIFIED

The researcher extracted 5 concrete lessons from the P3-10 implementation. I verified each against the implementation summary (`docs/progress/plan-sales-implementation-summary.md`) and primary source files:

**1a. 55KB SKILL.md size**: Verified. plan-sales SKILL.md is 1182 lines. The skill-structure.sh printf bug was real and fixed. The researcher's estimate of 1000-1400 lines for P3-14 is reasonable -- Structured Debate adds cross-examination (more phases than Collaborative Analysis) but has fewer analysis agents (2 debate positions vs 3 researchers). I would expect the upper end (1200-1400 lines) given that cross-examination orchestration instructions are inherently verbose. The estimate is directionally sound.

**1b. Lead-driven synthesis**: Verified. The implementation summary confirms Phase 3 was explicitly designed as lead-driven synthesis, and all 14 success criteria passed. The researcher's recommendation to follow this precedent for P3-14 is correct. The nuance about synthesizing opposing positions vs. parallel research is a real distinction worth noting in the P3-14 spec.

**1c. Dual-skeptic pattern**: Verified. The skill-shared-content.sh validator was updated for strategy-skeptic during implementation. Bias Skeptic + Fit Skeptic are documented in business-skill-design-guidelines.md line 32 for plan-hiring. The mechanical validator update is a known step.

**1d. Collaborative Analysis vs. Pipeline orchestration**: Verified. The plan-sales SKILL.md is 1182 lines vs. draft-investor-update at 737. The difference is attributable to cross-reference messaging instructions in Phase 2. Sound analysis.

**1e. Agent idle risk**: Verified. The implementation summary (line 74) explicitly states: "The quality-skeptic approved the pre-implementation gate but did not complete the post-implementation review before going idle." The researcher's recommendation for explicit fallback instructions in the P3-14 spec is appropriate. This is a real risk that should be designed around.

**Assessment**: All 5 lessons are evidence-based and traceable to primary sources. No speculation. APPROVED.

### 2. P2-07 Readiness -- APPROVED (with skill count correction)

Both agents agree P2-07 is not ready. Correct.

**Skill count correction**: The researcher's Section 2 table says "Total skills: 6" and "Multi-agent skills with shared content: 5." The researcher's Section 8 delta table says "P2-07 at 5/8." This is inconsistent. The RC5 ruling was: "use total skill count (5/8) for simplicity." At 6 total skills post P3-10 implementation, the correct tracking number is **6/8**, not 5/8.

The architect correctly states 6/8. The researcher's Section 2 prose is correct (6 total) but the Section 8 delta shorthand (5/8) uses the wrong denominator-tracking format -- it should read "P2-07 at 6/8."

This does not affect the conclusion. At 6/8 we are still 2 short of the ADR-002 threshold. P2-07 remains premature.

**ADR-002 threshold language**: I re-read ADR-002 line 55-57. The exact text is: "When the skill count exceeds 8, revisit this approach." The word "exceeds" means >8, not >=8. Technically, P2-07 triggers at 9 skills, not 8. However, RC5 noted "pre-plan extraction at 7." Both agents' recommendation to wait is correct regardless of whether the trigger is 8 or 9. This is worth flagging for clarity in future cycles.

---

### 3. P2-08 Readiness -- THE KEY DISAGREEMENT

The researcher recommends waiting (MEDIUM confidence). The architect recommends speccing now. Both agree the prerequisite is met (2/2 business skills).

**The disagreement is about whether we need all 3 patterns validated before designing plugin boundaries.**

The researcher argues: Structured Debate may introduce structurally different requirements, so wait until P3-14 is validated.

The architect argues: Domain boundaries (engineering vs. business) are the natural split, and domain boundaries are pattern-independent.

**My assessment: The architect is right on the merits, but the timing is wrong.**

Here is my reasoning:

1. The P2-08 prerequisite says "2+ business skills built and validated" -- this is met. The prerequisite does NOT say "all consensus patterns validated." The researcher is adding a condition that was never specified.

2. The architect correctly observes that the most natural plugin split is domain-based, not pattern-based. Patterns span domains (Hub-and-Spoke is engineering, Pipeline and Collaborative Analysis are business). A pattern-based split was already ruled out. This means Structured Debate validation is irrelevant to the plugin boundary question.

3. However, P2-08 is a P2 item (Important, not Critical). The immediate priority is speccing P3-14. Speccing P2-08 now creates parallel workstreams that compete for review attention. The correct prioritization is: P3-14 spec first, P2-08 spec second.

4. Additionally, implementing P3-14 before speccing P2-08 gives us one more data point: a business skill using the Structured Debate pattern. Even if the plugin split is domain-based, having 3 business skills (instead of 2) to observe before designing plugin organization is strictly better and costs nothing -- we would not implement P2-08 before P3-14 anyway.

**My ruling**: P2-08 prerequisite is met. It is eligible for speccing. But do NOT spec it this cycle. Spec P3-14 first. Re-evaluate P2-08 in RC7 after P3-14 is specced and ideally implemented. The practical outcome is the same as the researcher's recommendation (wait), but for different reasons (sequencing priority, not missing prerequisites).

### 4. P3-14 Sequencing Condition -- VERIFIED AND MET

The RC5 condition was: "Do NOT spec P3-14 until P3-10 is implemented."

Verified:
- P3-10 roadmap status: `complete`
- P3-10 implementation summary: all 14 success criteria met, all CI passing
- P3-10 SKILL.md exists at `plugins/conclave/skills/plan-sales/SKILL.md`
- Git commit `c63a0b6`: "P3-10: Implement /plan-sales Collaborative Analysis skill + fix 3 CI validator bugs"

The condition is unambiguously met. P3-14 can proceed to spec.

---

### 5. Roadmap Stubs -- VERIFIED

The RC5 condition was: "stubs must be minimal (frontmatter + one-line problem), NOT pre-specs."

I spot-checked 3 of the 14 stubs (P3-14, P3-12, P3-21):
- All have proper YAML frontmatter (title, status, priority, category, effort, impact, dependencies, created, updated)
- All have a single-sentence problem statement under `## Problem`
- None contain proposed solutions, success criteria, or architectural speculation

The architect's stubs comply with the RC5 condition. **APPROVED.**

**Effort mapping note**: The architect correctly flagged that _index.md uses "Medium-Large" and "Small-Medium" but the validator only accepts `small | medium | large`. The mappings (Medium-Large -> large, Small-Medium -> small) are reasonable but not conservative. Medium-Large -> large rounds up; Small-Medium -> small rounds down. This introduces a mild asymmetry. However, effort is an estimate, not a measurement, and these stubs are for items that have not been researched. The mapping is acceptable. The real fix is to decide whether the validator should be expanded or _index.md should be normalized. This is LOW priority and can be deferred.

**14 stubs created, 31/31 roadmap coverage**: Verified by file listing. The data integrity debt from RC4/RC5 is fully resolved.

---

### 6. RC5 Conditions Compliance

Checking all 4 conditions from the RC5 summary:

| RC5 Condition | Status | Evidence |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| Do NOT spec P3-14 until P3-10 is implemented | **MET** | P3-10 status: complete, commit c63a0b6 |
| Roadmap stubs must be minimal | **MET** | Spot-checked 3/14, all minimal |
| Stop reporting P2-02 in review cycles | **MET** | Neither report mentions P2-02 |
| CI fixes should be addressed before P3-10 implementation | **MET** (bundled) | 3 fixes included in P3-10 implementation commit |

All RC5 conditions are satisfied.

---

### 7. Architect Report Quality Assessment

The architect's RC6 report is a significant improvement over RC5. In RC5, I noted the architect's report "reads like a summary of the researcher's report rather than an independent technical assessment." In RC6:

- The architect independently ran all 5 CI validators and reported results with file counts
- The architect created 14 roadmap stubs (concrete deliverable, not just assessment)
- The P2-08 assessment includes 5 specific observations about domain separation, shared content, and output directories -- independent technical analysis, not echoing the researcher
- The P2-08 recommendation (ready to spec) diverges from the researcher (wait), demonstrating independent judgment

This is the level of independent analysis I expect. Noted for the record.

---

### 8. What Is Missing (Minor, Not Rejection-Worthy)

1. **P2-08 roadmap file is stale**: Still says "1/2 business skills complete" (line 23 of the file). The researcher flagged this in Section 6. Neither agent actually updated it. This is a trivial factual correction that should be made.

2. **No implementation risk assessment for P3-14**: Same gap as RC5. Neither report identifies what could go wrong with the Structured Debate pattern implementation. The researcher identifies the cross-examination phase as more complex than cross-referencing but does not flag specific risks (e.g., agents failing to stay in-character for assigned positions, cross-examination devolving into agreement rather than genuine challenge, or the synthesis failing to integrate genuinely opposing views). This is an observation for the spec phase, not a blocker for this review.

3. **Effort enum mismatch resolution path unclear**: The architect flagged the _index.md vs. validator mismatch. Neither agent proposes which should change. My recommendation: normalize _index.md to match the validator enum (`small | medium | large`). The validator is the enforcement mechanism; the index should conform to it, not the other way around. LOW priority.

---

### 9. Key Decisions from This Review

1. **P3-14 (plan-hiring) is cleared to spec.** The RC5 sequencing condition is met. Implementation lessons have been extracted. Proceed.

2. **P2-07 remains premature.** 6/8 total skills. Wait for 7/8 to pre-plan, 8+ to execute.

3. **P2-08 prerequisite is met but do not spec this cycle.** Spec P3-14 first. Re-evaluate P2-08 in RC7.

4. **14 roadmap stubs are created and compliant.** 31/31 coverage. Data integrity debt resolved.

5. **Update P2-08 roadmap file** from "1/2" to "2/2" business skills. Factual correction.

6. **No new skeptic conditions added this cycle.** The RC5 conditions were sufficient and have been met.

---

### 10. Recommended Action Sequence

1. Spec P3-14 (plan-hiring) -- the Structured Debate pathfinder
2. Update P2-08 roadmap file (1/2 -> 2/2) -- factual housekeeping
3. Implement P3-14 -- validates the final consensus pattern
4. RC7: Re-assess P2-07 (should be 7/8) and P2-08 (3 business skills, 3 patterns)
