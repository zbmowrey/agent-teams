# Plan-Hiring (P3-14) Spec Summary

## Outcome

**Spec approved** by product-skeptic. P3-14 is now ready for implementation (status: `ready`).

- Spec: `docs/specs/plan-hiring/spec.md`
- System design: `docs/architecture/plan-hiring-system-design.md`
- Roadmap: P3-14 status updated `not_started` -> `ready`

## What Was Produced

### Spec: `/plan-hiring` -- First Structured Debate Skill

A multi-agent Structured Debate skill that produces a hiring plan for early-stage startups. Key design:

- **6-agent team**: Team Lead + Researcher + Growth Advocate + Resource Optimizer + Bias Skeptic + Fit Skeptic
- **6-phase protocol**: Research -> Case Building -> Cross-Examination -> Synthesis -> Review -> Finalize
- **3-message cross-examination rounds**: Challenge -> Response -> Rebuttal (challenger gets last word), 2 mandatory rounds + 1 optional Lead-directed round
- **Position tracking**: MAINTAINED / MODIFIED / CONCEDED per challenged claim, plus "Remaining Tensions" for synthesis
- **Points of Agreement**: Captured in challenge format, distinct from Concessions
- **Dual-skeptic gate**: Bias Skeptic (fairness, legal, inclusive language) + Fit Skeptic (role necessity, budget, strategic fit)
- **Debate Resolution Summary**: New output section unique to Structured Debate, making synthesis reasoning transparent
- **20 testable success criteria**
- **2 files to modify**: SKILL.md (create) + skill-shared-content.sh (4 new sed expressions)

### Key Divergences Resolved

The researcher and architect diverged on 5 fundamental design decisions. The skeptic rejected the first submission, and the team lead resolved all 5:

| # | Divergence | Resolution |
|---|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Agent name (Sustainability Advocate vs Resource Optimizer) | Resource Optimizer -- more specific, less ideological |
| 2 | Team composition (with/without Researcher) | 6 agents WITH Researcher -- prevents evidence-shopping |
| 3 | Cross-exam depth (6 vs 4 messages) | 3-message rounds (6 total) -- challenger gets last word |
| 4 | Rebuttal format | Position tracking + Remaining Tensions (hybrid) |
| 5 | Agreement handling | Points of Agreement in challenge format |

## Agent Activity

| Agent | Work Done |
|-------|-----------|
| Researcher | Comprehensive domain research, debate position design, protocol design, validator analysis, reconciliation proposal for 5 divergences |
| Architect | Full system design (1074 lines), revised per skeptic feedback (added Researcher, upgraded cross-exam) |
| Product Skeptic | Initial review (REJECTED with 5 divergences + 3 blocking issues), architecture re-review (APPROVED), final spec review (APPROVED -- all 12 requirements passed) |
| Team Lead | Divergence resolution, spec writing, roadmap update |

## Review Trail

1. **Researcher findings** -> Skeptic preliminary feedback (5 items incorporated)
2. **Architect system design** -> Skeptic REJECTED (5 divergences, 3 blocking issues)
3. **Architect revision** (per skeptic feedback) -> Skeptic APPROVED architecture
4. **Team Lead wrote spec** (resolving all divergences) -> Skeptic APPROVED spec (12/12 requirements passed)

## New Patterns Validated (at spec level)

This is the first Structured Debate skill. Implementation will validate:
- Cross-examination protocol (adversarial, not cooperative)
- Position tracking (MAINTAINED/MODIFIED/CONCEDED)
- Debate Resolution Summary (synthesis transparency)
- Shared evidence base via Researcher agent
- Dual new skeptic types (Bias + Fit)
