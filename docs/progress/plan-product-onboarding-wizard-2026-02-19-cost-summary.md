# Plan-Product: Onboarding Wizard — Cost Summary

## Team Composition

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| Team Lead (PO) | Opus | Orchestration, spec aggregation |
| Researcher | Opus | Feasibility research, codebase analysis |
| Architect | Opus | System design, ADR authoring |
| DBA | Opus | Data model evaluation |
| Product Skeptic | Opus | Quality gate, review all deliverables |

## Deliverables Produced

1. **Research findings** — `docs/progress/onboarding-wizard-researcher.md`
2. **System design** — `docs/architecture/onboarding-wizard-system-design.md`
3. **ADR-003** — `docs/architecture/ADR-003-onboarding-wizard-single-agent.md`
4. **Data model evaluation** — `docs/architecture/onboarding-wizard-data-model.md`
5. **Final spec** — `docs/specs/onboarding-wizard/spec.md`
6. **Roadmap update** — `docs/roadmap/P3-02-onboarding-wizard.md` (status: ready)

## Review Cycles

- Researcher findings: 1 cycle (approved first pass)
- Architect design + ADR: 1 cycle (approved first pass)
- DBA evaluation: 1 cycle (approved first pass)
- All deliverables approved by Product Skeptic without rejections

## Key Decisions

1. Single-agent architecture (no team spawning, no skeptic gate)
2. File-existence-based idempotency (no marker files, no content hashing)
3. Templates embedded in SKILL.md (self-contained, no external dependencies)
4. CLAUDE.md never silently overwritten (suggest-only when exists)
5. Create-only for roadmaps (no augmentation of existing roadmap items)
6. Validator adaptation required as prerequisite (type: single-agent frontmatter flag)

## Notes

- Clean execution — no rejections, no deadlocks, no re-spawns needed
- All agents reached consensus independently on single-agent + no-data-model conclusion
- Critical finding: CI validator conflict identified early by Researcher, confirmed by all agents
