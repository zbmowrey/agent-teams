## Progress Notes

- [00:00] Received task #3: Write setup-project SKILL.md
- [00:00] Read spec at docs/specs/onboarding-wizard/spec.md
- [00:00] Read system design at docs/architecture/onboarding-wizard-system-design.md
- [00:00] Read existing SKILL.md files (plan-product, build-product) for format conventions
- [00:00] Read validator at scripts/validators/skill-structure.sh — confirmed it requires multi-agent sections that will break a single-agent SKILL.md
- [00:00] Read template files (docs/specs/_template.md, docs/progress/_template.md, docs/architecture/_template.md)
- [00:00] Task is BLOCKED: waiting for Task #1 (impl-architect plan approved) and Task #2 (validator modified for single-agent support)
- [00:00] All reading complete. Ready to write SKILL.md once blockers are resolved.
- [00:01] Received impl-architect's full implementation plan. Plan is clear and actionable.
- [00:01] Key plan notes: type: single-agent in frontmatter, ## Setup + ## Determine Mode required by validator, plugin.json does NOT need modification (auto-discovery).
- [00:01] Still blocked on Task #2 (backend-eng validator modification). Will write SKILL.md immediately once validator is updated.
- [00:02] Plan approved by quality-skeptic. impl-architect confirmed Task #3 assignment with full spec. Still blocked on Task #2.
- [00:03] backend-eng confirmed Task #2 complete. Created plugins/conclave/skills/setup-project/SKILL.md.
- [00:03] Discovered B1/B2 validators in skill-shared-content.sh also needed single-agent exemption. Reported to backend-eng and tech-lead.
- [00:04] backend-eng fixed skill-shared-content.sh. Full CI validation: 11 passed, 0 failed.
- [00:04] Task #3 complete. SKILL.md at plugins/conclave/skills/setup-project/SKILL.md. Notifying quality-skeptic.
