## Progress Notes

- [00:00] Claimed task #2, read implementation plan (docs/progress/progress-observability-impl-architect.md File 4 section), read spec-frontmatter.sh for pattern reference
- [00:01] Created scripts/validators/progress-checkpoint.sh with exact content from plan, made executable
- [00:02] Edited scripts/validate.sh to add run_validator "progress-checkpoint.sh" after spec-frontmatter.sh line
- [00:03] Ran bash scripts/validate.sh -- all 11 validators pass; E1/required-fields validated 24 checkpoint files with 0 failures
