# Product Skeptic Review: Feature Selection and Spec Review

## Review 1: Feature Selection Recommendation (Task #3)

**Verdict: APPROVED (with conditions)**

Both the researcher and architect recommend P2-03 Progress Observability as the next feature to spec. After independent verification of their claims against the codebase, I concur -- but with specific conditions that must be addressed in the spec.

## Review 2: P2-03 Progress Observability Specification (Task #5)

**Verdict: APPROVED (with one required correction)**

The spec is well-structured, addresses all 5 of my conditions from the feature selection review, and is ready for implementation after one factual error is corrected.

### Condition Checklist

| # | Condition | Met? | Notes |
|---|-----------|------|-------|
| 1 | Honest effort assessment (Medium, not Small-Medium) | YES | Spec scopes to Medium implicitly via the work described. Frontmatter does not include an effort field (not required by spec template). The scope of work described is consistent with Medium. |
| 2 | Explicit acknowledgment of inconsistent summary conventions | YES | Problem statement #3 correctly states: "Team leads are instructed to write {feature}-summary.md files... but the format and completeness vary." |
| 3 | Clear definition of status mode scope in Determine Mode | YES | Section 1 provides exact markdown text to add to each SKILL.md. Clear and implementable. |
| 4 | Cross-skill consistency in status report format | YES | Section 2 defines a single report format. Phase enum variation handled by displaying raw values. |
| 5 | Explicit boundary against real-time monitoring | YES | Out of Scope section item 1: "the status command reads files at a point in time. It does not watch for changes or provide live updates." |

### What the Spec Gets Right

1. **Clear separation of concerns.** The spec has 4 components (status mode, report format, summary formalization, optional validator) with clean boundaries between them. Each can be implemented and tested independently.

2. **Constraints are well-defined.** The 6 constraints are specific, testable, and correctly scoped. Constraint #1 (no agent spawning) is the most important architectural decision and it is stated clearly.

3. **Out of Scope is thorough.** Seven items explicitly excluded. This prevents scope creep during implementation. Cross-skill status, historical tracking, and real-time streaming are all correctly deferred.

4. **Success criteria are testable.** 12 numbered criteria, each verifiable by the build team. The criteria cover the happy path, empty state, backward compatibility, and the optional validator.

5. **Phase enum handling is pragmatic.** Displaying raw values rather than normalizing is the right call. Normalization would add complexity with no user benefit -- the phase names are self-explanatory within their skill context.

6. **The summary convention gap is honestly addressed.** The Problem section acknowledges that only build-product currently writes a summary. The Solution section adds the convention to all 3 skills. This was my primary concern from the feature selection review.

7. **The checkpoint validator is correctly marked optional.** It respects the P2-04 spec's original exclusion of progress files while acknowledging that the status command changes the calculus.

### Blocking Issue (Must Fix Before Implementation)

**ISSUE: Step numbering is wrong.**

The spec states the end-of-session summary step should be added as:
> "N. ... Where N is the next step number (6 for plan-product, 8 for build-product, 8 for review-quality)"

This is incorrect for plan-product. The current orchestration flow for plan-product has 7 steps:
1. Create tasks for each agent based on the mode
2. Let Researcher and Architect/DBA work in parallel
3. Route all outputs through the Skeptic
4. Iterate until Skeptic approves
5. **Team Lead only**: Aggregate agent outputs and write final spec
6. **Team Lead only**: Update docs/roadmap/ with new/changed items
7. **Team Lead only**: Write cost summary

The new summary step would be step **8**, not step 6. The spec needs to correct this to: "8 for plan-product, 9 for build-product, 9 for review-quality."

This is a factual error that could cause confusion during implementation but does not affect the spec's design. It can be fixed trivially.

### Non-Blocking Observations

1. **Problem statement #3 is slightly inaccurate.** It says team leads are "instructed to write {feature}-summary.md files (plan-product step 5, build-product step 7, review-quality step 7)." But plan-product step 5 writes the spec, not a summary. Only build-product step 7 explicitly writes a summary. Review-quality step 7 writes {feature}-quality.md, not {feature}-summary.md. The distinction matters for honesty about the current state but does not affect the solution design.

2. **The `team` field filter for status mode could match stale data.** The spec says status mode reads files with `team: "{skill-name}"` in their frontmatter. This will include checkpoint files from completed features alongside in-progress ones. Success criterion #7 handles the "no checkpoints" case, but there is no guidance on how to present mixed completed/in-progress results. The implementation team should consider filtering by `status` field (showing only non-complete checkpoints by default) or grouping results by feature. This is a UX detail the build team can resolve.

3. **The existing `{feature}-quality.md` convention in review-quality is not addressed.** Review-quality step 7 currently writes `{feature}-quality.md`. The spec adds a new step for `{feature}-summary.md`. Should review-quality write both? Should `{feature}-quality.md` be renamed to `{feature}-summary.md` for consistency? This is a minor scope question the build team can resolve, but the spec could be more explicit.

### Final Assessment

The spec is solid. The design is minimal, builds on existing infrastructure, and addresses a real user need. The constraints and out-of-scope sections demonstrate disciplined scoping. The success criteria are testable.

The one blocking issue (step numbering) is a trivial factual error. Once corrected, this spec is ready for implementation.

**Verdict: APPROVED** -- pending the step numbering correction described above. This correction does not require a re-review cycle. The architect or team lead can fix it and proceed to implementation.
