# Business Skill Design Guidelines

Framework-level design requirements for all future skills, with emphasis on business-domain skills. Established during the Product Team review cycle (2026-02-18) per Skeptic conditional approval.

## Multi-Skeptic Assignments

Every team MUST include at least one negative persona (Skeptic). Most teams SHOULD include two, covering non-overlapping failure-mode scopes. Per PO directive: be liberal with negative personas.

### Engineering Skills

| Skill | Skeptic 1 | Skeptic 2 |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| `/triage-incident` | **Quality Skeptic** — Solution correctness, root cause validity | **Ops Skeptic** — Blast radius, rollback safety, monitoring gaps |
| `/review-debt` | **Code Quality Skeptic** — Severity ratings, remediation approach | **Business Impact Skeptic** — Prioritization, opportunity cost |
| `/design-api` | **Consistency Skeptic** — Conventions, naming, versioning | **Consumer Advocate** — Usability, backwards compatibility, documentation |
| `/plan-migration` | **Risk Skeptic** — Data loss, downtime, dependency chains | **Rollback Skeptic** — Reversibility, contingency plans, testing coverage |

### Business Skills

| Skill | Skeptic 1 | Skeptic 2 |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| `/plan-sales` | **Accuracy Skeptic** — Claims, projections, market data | **Strategy Skeptic** — Market fit, competitive positioning, pricing |
| `/plan-marketing` | **ROI Skeptic** — Budget justification, attribution, metrics | **Brand Skeptic** — Messaging consistency, audience fit, tone |
| `/plan-finance` | **Financial Rigor Skeptic** — Model accuracy, assumption sensitivity | **Regulatory Skeptic** — Compliance, reporting requirements, audit trail |
| `/plan-hiring` | **Bias Skeptic** — Fairness, legal compliance, inclusive language | **Fit Skeptic** — Role necessity, team composition, budget alignment |
| `/plan-customer-success` | **Retention Skeptic** — Churn risk signals, intervention timing | **Scalability Skeptic** — Process sustainability at growth targets |
| `/build-sales-collateral` | **Accuracy Skeptic** — Claims backed by evidence, proof points | **Effectiveness Skeptic** — Persuasiveness, differentiation, call to action |
| `/build-content` | **Quality Skeptic** — Writing standards, originality, accuracy | **Strategy Skeptic** — Audience alignment, SEO, distribution fit |
| `/review-legal` | **Completeness Skeptic** — Coverage, edge cases, jurisdiction | **Severity Skeptic** — Risk assessment, prioritization, remediation urgency |
| `/plan-analytics` | **Methodology Skeptic** — Statistical validity, sample bias, confounders | **Actionability Skeptic** — Decision relevance, metric gaming risk |
| `/plan-operations` | **Efficiency Skeptic** — Waste identification, bottleneck analysis | **Risk Skeptic** — Single points of failure, vendor lock-in, resilience |
| `/plan-onboarding` | **Completeness Skeptic** — Coverage of roles, tools, processes | **Experience Skeptic** — New hire perspective, cognitive load, time-to-productivity |
| `/draft-investor-update` | **Accuracy Skeptic** — Numbers, claims, milestone verification | **Narrative Skeptic** — Spin detection, omission, consistency with prior updates |

### High-Stakes Domains (3 Skeptics)

Some domains warrant a third negative persona due to regulatory or financial risk:

| Skill | Additional Skeptic |
|-------|-------------------|
| `/plan-finance` | **Investor Readiness Skeptic** — Due diligence preparedness, fundraising narrative coherence |
| `/review-legal` | **Precedent Skeptic** — Case law awareness, enforceability, jurisdictional variation |

## Consensus-Building Patterns

Business teams use one of three collaboration patterns, chosen per-skill based on the nature of the work. All patterns emphasize peer-to-peer communication — agents message each other directly, not just through the lead.

### Collaborative Analysis

All agents investigate simultaneously, share findings in real-time via peer-to-peer messaging, and build on each other's discoveries. Best for research-heavy skills where diverse perspectives compound.

**Best for**: `/plan-sales`, `/plan-marketing`, `/plan-customer-success`, `/plan-analytics`

**Pattern**: Agents work in parallel → share partial findings via `SendMessage` → cross-reference and challenge each other's work → synthesize collaboratively → Skeptics validate the synthesis.

### Structured Debate

Agents take defined positions (pro/con, optimistic/conservative, risk-seeking/risk-averse), present evidence-backed arguments, and a neutral party synthesizes. Best for high-stakes decisions where premature consensus is dangerous.

**Best for**: `/plan-finance`, `/review-legal`, `/plan-operations`, `/plan-hiring`

**Pattern**: Agents are assigned perspectives → each builds their case independently → cases are presented to the full team → cross-examination via direct messages → Skeptics judge the debate → synthesis produced.

### Pipeline

Sequential handoffs with quality gates between stages. Each stage builds on the validated output of the previous stage. Best for production/build skills where the output has a clear sequential structure.

**Best for**: `/build-sales-collateral`, `/build-content`, `/draft-investor-update`, `/plan-onboarding`

**Pattern**: Research → Draft → Review → Revise → Final validation. Each stage has a defined handoff artifact and acceptance criteria.

## Quality Without Ground Truth

Engineering skills verify outputs against code (tests pass, builds succeed, schemas validate). Business skills lack this ground truth — their outputs are verified against assumptions, projections, and judgment. This creates a quality risk that must be mitigated at the framework level.

### Mandatory Output Requirements

All non-engineering skill outputs MUST include:

1. **Assumptions & Limitations section** — Every deliverable explicitly states what it assumes to be true and what constraints apply. Skeptics verify this section is complete and honest. Hidden assumptions are a rejection-worthy defect.

2. **Confidence levels** — All projections, estimates, and forecasts include a confidence qualifier (High / Medium / Low) with rationale. Skeptics reject unqualified certainty.

3. **Falsification triggers** — Each major conclusion answers: "What evidence would change this conclusion?" Skeptics verify these triggers are specific and testable, not vague.

4. **External validation checkpoints** — Skill outputs identify where human domain expertise should validate AI-generated analysis. The framework structures judgment — it does not replace it.

### Skeptic Enforcement Checklist

Skeptics in business skills must specifically verify:

- [ ] Are assumptions stated, not hidden?
- [ ] Are confidence levels present and justified?
- [ ] Are falsification triggers specific and actionable?
- [ ] Does the output acknowledge what it doesn't know?
- [ ] Would a domain expert find the framing credible?
- [ ] Are projections grounded in stated evidence, not optimism?

## Product Strategy Scope

Strategic planning is scoped within the existing `/plan-product` skill rather than a standalone `/plan-strategy` skill. The plan-product team already performs strategic analysis as part of roadmap assessment, competitive analysis, and prioritization. A separate strategy skill would create scope overlap and fragment the strategic conversation. If strategy needs grow beyond what plan-product covers, this decision can be revisited.
